### Requeriments
* GCC
* CMake

### Why did you create this?
I made this for CS50x Harvard University (Final Project), just for fun so this's not a serious language it's just for a hobby to learn more C.

### How can I compile it?
    
    git clone https://github.com/paulohenriquesn/moon
    mkdir /src/build
    cd /src/build
    cmake ../
    make
